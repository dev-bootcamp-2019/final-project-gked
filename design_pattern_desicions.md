# Design Patterns

Given the nature of this DApp, I know that, will need to add new features to this contract but unfortunately, I run out of time to think through a design pattern for future upgradability for extra credit. 

I will have to implement the proper patterns post due date. 

I will be looking to implement Registry Contract design patterns.
